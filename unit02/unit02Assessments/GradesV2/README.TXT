<+s>: The assessment actually took me a couple minutes to start because I was trying 
to figure out what I should write first. I also had some confusion with the data type 
conversions but after some practice I understood. After that, it was a breeze.  

<-s>: I had some confusion with the data type conversions and I was having a hard time 
understanding the ranges for ints and doubles. I was having a bit of diffuculty.
****************************************************************************************
In the future: In the future, I think it would be helpful to plan everything out 
on a piece of paper before actually coding it because I was having a hard time starting 
the code. I also think I should practice some problems to understand the concept before 
doing the assessment.
