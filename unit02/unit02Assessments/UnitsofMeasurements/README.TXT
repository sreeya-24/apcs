PROJECT TITLE: Units of Measurement

AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Run this program

**************************** P M R **************************************************
 
<+s>: The assessment was a bit confusing at first because I didn't know if we 
had to make up our own conversions. However, that confusion got clear up when 
I saw the sample output. This time, I was a little bit more careful when formatting 
my code and making sure the code is clear. The examples really helped understand what 
I was coding.
      
<-s>: There were times where I forgot to make variables for certain measurments such 
as pounds and liters and I forgot to intialize them causing syntax errors. 

           
************************************************************************************
In the future: Again, I would be careful of what I am writing in my code and check 
to see whether there is a variable already made or not. Also, I would take time to 
check if I repeated any parts of my code.
