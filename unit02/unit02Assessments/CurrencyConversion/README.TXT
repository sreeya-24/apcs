<+s>: The program was a little confusing and I didn't quite understand what I was 
supposed to do. However, after reading the instructions multiple times, I finally 
understood and got the hang of it. I made sure to beautify my cpde as I went through 
that way I wasn't getting confused what part of code is doing what.
      
<-s>: The original variables that were already there in the code confused me a little 
bit but I decided to make my own variables which made things a lot more easier. Another 
small conflict was that conversions from one country to another were not exactly up to 
date, so I was confused as to why it wasn't the right value.
           
******************************************************************************************
In the future: I would read the instructions more carefully and make sure I understood 
what I was supposed to do. I would also do a better job labeling/commenting parts of code
that way I don't get confused.
