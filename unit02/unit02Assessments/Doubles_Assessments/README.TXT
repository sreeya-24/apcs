**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The assessment was straightforward and it didn't take much time to figure how 
to set up the variables and how to use concatenation. There were a couple of times 
where I forgot to create a variable for new integers or doubles. However, I quickly 
caught on.
      
<-s>: There was definitely a lot of times where I forgot to put semi-colons which 
resulted in syntax errors. Formatting the code and making sure there were no typos 
was time-consuming.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: Instead of trying to finish quickly, I would take my time to make 
sure there are no errors and typos. In addition, I would make sure I am formatting 
while I am writing my code.
