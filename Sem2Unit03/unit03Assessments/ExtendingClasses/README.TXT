PROJECT TITLE: Extending Classes
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This project shows the concept of inheritance between classes by using geometric shapes.
VERSION or DATE: 3/06/2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Compile and run
AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Compile and run each test class.

**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: This project really helped me understand what inheritance was how it worked between classes. 
I think I understood this concept pretty well especially because I am take AP Biology and I learn 
about inheritance and genes. I think making that connection was helpful. It was really nice not 
having to write the same code over and over again and it hardly took anytime at all.

<-s>: I didn't run into any complications and everything was organized. It was really nice seeing 
that my code didn't take up so much time and space and by using shapes, I think I undeerstood it
 better than I would have.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I think making connections to real-life things or other things that I learn about 
helped me in understanding the concept. In the future, I would continuing making these connections 
for better understanding.
