**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: I think I understood the concept of polymorphism pretty well. Although it was a bit 
confusing at first because it seemed quite similar to class hierarchies. However, after some more 
reading I got a better understanding of this concept. I didn't run into ay complications and I think 
the virtual lecture notes helped a lot in seeing the difference between polymorphism and class 
hierarchies.

<-s>: I didn't run into any complications and I made sure to examine the super class and the 
subclasses well before writing code in the main class. Writing the code was a breeze and my 
program ran smoothly.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I think the virtual lecture always help in every project because I see the actual 
code instead of reading it. In the future, I will continue to examine the notes carefully and make 
sure I understand.
