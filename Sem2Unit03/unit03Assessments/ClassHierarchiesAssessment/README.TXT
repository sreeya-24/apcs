<+s>: This project was not a problem for me. I understood the concept and knew what I had to 
do. I didn't run into any problems and it was a breeze for me. The eIMACS really helped me through 
this concept and it wasn't time consuming.

<-s>: Again, there were no complications as I was writing my code and testing it. I knew from the 
diagram that the mountain and tree classes were direct subclasses of the terrain class and the 
winter mountain class was a direct sub class of the mountain class and a subclass of the terrain 
class. Because I didn't have rewrite similar code in every class, it helped me save time and energy.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I think the eIMACS lessons are helpful when learning. I will continue to understand 
these lessons to make the project easier.
