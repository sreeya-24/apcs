**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: This project was pretty easy and light. I think I somewhat understood what overriding 
methods are. I didn't have much complications writing the program and running it. However, I 
was a bit stuck on how to add the equals method with getting an error. But after some contemplating, 
I found out a way and after that I just print everything and my program ran smoothly.

<-s>: Again, I had some trouble with creating the equals method and I didn't how I could write it 
in the box class without the length and width. But I found a way and I didn't have any problems 
with it.

In the future: The lecture are really helpful and I am going to go back and review them to make 
sure I have a good understanding of the concept. I will continue doing the same thing.
