<+s>: The first couple steps of this lab were pretty smooth and easy to do. I followed the 
directions and and copied my code to BlueJ. The steps in the middle were a bit difficult but 
they were managable. However, the last step where we had to create the receive method was 
extremely hard. I spent about like 2 hours just for this method. It would give me the wrong 
output and I didn't know how to fix it. 

<-s>: Step 13 was extremely hard. I would get the wrong output or the loop would go and not stop. 
I didn't know what I was doing wrong and at first I thought it was because it was random. But it
didn't make sense. It took me 2 hours before it worked and the output was something similar. 
I had to add a couple if loops and make sure it's not going on an infinite loop. But this step 
was really frustrating and I had to take a break before coming back to this.
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I think taking breaks when you are stuck on a project is really helpful. It 
won't get you frustrated and you may save some time instead sitting there and getting 
irritated.
