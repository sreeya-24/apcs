<+s>: This assessment was fairly easy except I didn't fully understand what trajectory was. 
I think I am going to look into that a little bit more but I didn't run into that many issues. 
I did planned it out before out so I finished it a bit quicker than usual. Again, formatting 
took the most time but not as long as it did for the previous project.
      
<-s>: The fomratting, as usual, took the most time among everything else. I do need to practice 
more. I just used trial and error for the most part. Other than formatting, I didn't run into any 
other issues and there were no syntax or runtime errors. I did ended adding another column but 
it was fine the results printed our fairly accurate.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: Planning really helped with this Challenge program. I also need to practice 
formatting in the future.
