<+s>: This assessment wasn't that hard. I glad I did it because it was review for me and I 
thought it was helpful. Especially because we are moving into semester 2, I think it's good to 
have a review like this so we are not forgetting certain things.

<-s>: There was some stuff which I think my brain needed to work a little hard to remember. 
Those were concepts that were in the beginning of semester 1 so my brain did put them aside. 
But, this assessment made me remember those concepts and I did look back at a couple of notes but 
not so much.

In the future: Keep practicing and revising the old lessons to make sure I am not forgetting them.
