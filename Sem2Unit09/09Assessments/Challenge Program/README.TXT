**************************** P M R********************************************************************
 
<+s>: At the beginning of the project, I knew that this was somewhat similar to the previous prject 
with some changes. So the first thing I did as take a look at that code and try to figure out what and 
where the changes would be. Later I made a pseudocode on how I would make those changes. I think it helped 
with writing my code because I had a plan set out.

<-s>: I didn't really run into any problems and the assessment instructions were straight forward. Again, 
previous projects and the pseudocode helped a lot. 
*******************************************************************************************************
In the future: Writing down the code on paper and planning out worked well. In the future I will continue 
doing the same thing.
