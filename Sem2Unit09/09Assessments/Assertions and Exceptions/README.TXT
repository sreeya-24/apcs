**************************** P M R********************************************************************
 
<+s>: I had no trouble finishing this project. In fact I didn't get any errors(any other errors other 
then the expected error) in the process and I felt really good after finishing it. I think I understood 
the concept of assertion and exceptions pretty well. The assessment instructions took me step by step 
throughout the process and it was really helpful.

<-s>: Again, I had no errors or problems doing it. I didn't run into any pitstops and it went pretty well. 
I am quite happy with it.
*******************************************************************************************************
In the future: Breaking down the project into smaller steps and writing a pseudocode was pretty helpful 
in this project. In the future I would continue to do the same thing.
