**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: I understood the concept of replacements very well but what took me the longest is to 
format and make sure the results were printing properly. However, I understood replacing well 
and I now know how to do it. However, I thnink doing the arrayList was more easier because I 
remember how to do ArrayLists better than arrays. Adding objects in ArrayLists are easier and 
faster than arrays. But my program ran smoothly without any errors.

<-s>: The formatting was the bigger problem. At the beginning, Original results did print data 
but After results didn't and original results would printed again. It turns out I wasn't supposed 
to put the header in the printResults method. After that, finally they printed but I had to format 
the data and make sure the numbers were left aligned and everything which was all trial and error.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: For the replace methods I wrote down the logic to help me with and it really was 
helpful. I will continue to write my code down first before writing on the IDE.
