<+s>: I think this concept was more of a review and the quiz helped me just recheck my skills 
and memory. I didn't run into any problems with this program. My program ran smoothly without 
any runtime or syntax errors. It was a piece of cake and it was fairly easy.

<-s>: Once again, I didn't have much trouble with my code. I only had a bit formatting problems 
but that was all trial and error. Other than that, I didn't run into any problems and the steps 
were pretty simplified so it helped a lot.

In the future: Writing and planning beforehand on paper really helped me in this assessment. I 
will continue doing that to make sure I am not wasting any time thinking about it last minute.
