<+s>: This assessment was fairly easy. I did run into some errors but I fixed those. Other than 
that, my program ran smoothly. I think understood the concept of deletion pretty well.

<-s>: I totally forgot about the NullPointerException so when I ran my program it gave 
NullPointerException. I fixed that with a couple of if loops and it was all set. After that my 
program ran smoothly and it was a success.

In the future: Writing and planning beforehand on paper really helped me in this assessment. I 
will continue doing that to make sure I am not wasting any time thinking about it last minute.
