**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: This project was somewhat easy. The StudentTester part was pretty easy because I knew how 
to do replacement, insertion, and deletion and on top of that I used an ArrayList so it made it 
a bit more easy. All of the topics were easy to understand so I was able to write the code for 
those successfully. I did run into some problems in the Student class.

<-s>: In the Student class, I was really confsed on how to do the getQuiz and setQuiz methods 
so I spent a lot of time on that. I had no clue what it was asking me to do and because there 
wasn't just one quiz, it made it extra hard. It took a lot thinking and at some point I started 
trial and erroring. I had write an if condition in them and then it fianlly worked.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: Understanding the concept made this project 10x easier than what it would have been. 
I will make sure to contiue doing that.
