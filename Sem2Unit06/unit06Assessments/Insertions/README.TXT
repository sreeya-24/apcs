**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: This project was really easy and the virtual lecture notes helped me a lot in understanding 
the concept of insertions. It was clear that in arrays the last item would disappear in array 
lists it would stay. I understood the concept very well and after I was done writing my code I 
was very confident with it. I didn't run into any syntax or runtime errors and everything went 
smoothly. 

<-s>: I didn't have any problem with my code and didn't run into any pitstops or errors. It was 
frustration-free. The lecture notes helped a lot because they clearly explained the concept of 
insertions.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: Because the virtual lecture notes were really helpful, I would continue to look 
and analyze them.
