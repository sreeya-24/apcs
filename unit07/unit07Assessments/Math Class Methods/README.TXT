PROJECT TITLE: Math Class Methods
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program calculates the x and y cordinates of a circle with radius 
1.0 using the Math class methods.
VERSION or DATE: 1/4/2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Compile and run
AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Compile and run the java file.

**************************** P M R****************************************************************
 
<+s>: The assessment was more on the easier side especially because it was quite straightforward 
with all of the Math class methods. Because these were some of the concepts we learn at school in 
math class, it just made it a bit easier. I didn't run into any big complications I just spent 
sometime on formatting and also printing the values.
      
<-s>: After finishing writing my code, I printed the output and it only printed the x values 
starting from 0.90 which is not what I wanted. I couldn't really figure out why it was doing 
that but I looked more closely at my for loop and realized that I was decrementing the x value at 
the begginning which was making it start from 0.90. After fixing that, everything went smoothly.
           
**************************************************************************************************
In the future: Looking more closely and paying attention to what I write in my code helped avoiding 
big confusions and spending too much time. In the future I will continue looking closely at my code 
to avoid wasting time and runtime errors.
