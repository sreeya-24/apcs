PROJECT TITLE: Declaring New Methods
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program calculates the surface gravity of each planet

VERSION or DATE: 1/9/2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Compile and run
AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Compile and run the java main file

<+s>: This assessment was a little bit difficult since I didn't really know how to start. 
My mind was just all over the place and I didn't know if I should start with main the method 
or the other methods. I also forgot part of how to write into a file and not writing that in 
the main function made it a bit more confusing.
      
<-s>: I did run into some index issues and I got runtime errors saying that the index was out 
bounds but I quickly resolvedc that. When I was adding in pluto it didn't display anything next 
to Pluto and I realized that the for loop still had the wrong index number. After that, I didn't 
run into anymore errors.

In the future: Instead of immediately starting the project, I should have planned it out more 
carefully on a piece of paper step by step. It would have saved much more time. In the future, 
plan out the assessment on a piece of paper.
