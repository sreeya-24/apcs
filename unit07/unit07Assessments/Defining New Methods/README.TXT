<+s>: Because I finished part 1 of the assessment it was fairly easy. I didn't really run into 
any complications other than formatting. I had to trial and error once again and that took the 
most time. I also had some trouble with the formula because the first I ran the program, the 
weight on each planet was the same. I modified it a little bit and it worked.
      
<-s>: There were a lot of loops I had to add so I got confused on which one is which. However, 
it was not that much of a problem. The formual and formatting did cause some trouble they took 
the most time but I fixed the formula with some changes and formatiing with some trial and error.

In the future: In the future, I would plan my code more effeciently and also comment my program 
along the way.
