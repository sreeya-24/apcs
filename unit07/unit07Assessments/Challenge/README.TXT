PROJECT TITLE: Challenge Program
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program takes user input of the number trials and 
the number of darts in each trial to calculate the value of pi.
VERSION or DATE: 1/9/2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Compile and run
AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Compile and run the main java file.

**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: The assessment was fairly easy. I didn't run into any pitstops and I was quite clear on 
what I was supposed to do. I made a function to generated random numbers for x and y and wrote
a loop to calculate the number of times the darts hit inside of the circle. In the same function 
I calculated the pi value for each trial. I just called this function in the main and calculated 
the average in a different function. It didn't take that long.
      
<-s>: Again, I understood how to do the project and it was not very difficult. I had to keep 
track of my variables since most of them have similar names but that wasn't really troublesome.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: This project, I went step by step instead of trying to do all at once. Surprisingly, 
it didn't take as long and it wasn't confusing. In the future, I will go step by step instead of 
doing everything at once.
