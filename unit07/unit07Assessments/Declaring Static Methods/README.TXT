<+s>: I actually thought that this project was going to be a little difficult since I am used to 
writing main function with void. However, it was fairly easy and I didn't run any runtime or syntax 
errors. I also had no problem writing the methods for gallons and liters. The comments really helped 
me understand this project and guided me througout the project.
      
<-s>: After running, I was confused why most of the statemnets were showing miles to kilometers and 
I thought it had something to do with their own methods. It turns out that the formatting was printing 
it out. After that, my program ran smoothly and I didn't run into anymore pitstops.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: The comments had helped me understand this project. It helps the user looking at 
the code grasp on the program. In the future, I will write my own comments to make sure the user 
who is looking at my code understands it.
