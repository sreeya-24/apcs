<+s>: This assessment was a bit time consuming but was on the easier side. For me 
it took a long time to find the number of times heads and tails were flipped for 
each of the 5 trials. However when it came to the population ratio I decided to 
put another while loop outside of the original while loop so it wouldn't take me 
so long to do all 5 trials.
      
<-s>: Again, this project was time-consuming and I spent a lot of time finding 
averages for both worksheets. However, I didn't really have any complications 
doing the project. 
           
********************************************************************************
In the future: Because of the while loop I added to the population ratio project, 
it went by much faster than the coin flip. I wsh I had done that sooner so I 
wasn't wasting anymore time but I actually didn't know if tat would work. Instead 
of pondering whether something will work, in the future I would just do it and see 
if it will work.
