PROJECT TITLE: Guessing Game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program asks the user to guess a random number the computer generated. 
If the random number matches they won. If it didn't they are asked to guess again. The second 
porgram asks the user to guess a random number the computer generated between their chosen range 
of numbers.

**************************** P M R ***************************************************************
 
<+s>: The first part of the assessment went smoothly and there weren't any 
complications. Everything was starightforward and I understood the concept well. 
I was a bit a confused on where to put certain statements(inside the while loop or outside?)
but that quickly got resolved. 
      
<-s>: I was a bit confused on the second part since it was confusing on how to set a range 
and make the computer generate a random number between that range. However, the given algorithm helped a 
lot and I finished the second part as well.
           
*************************************************************************************************
In the future: Understanding the concept and utilizing my resources helped a lot in this project 
so I will continue to do these thinsg in future assessments.
