**************************** P M R ***************************************************
 
<+s>: Reading text files was a little hard for me especially because I have been 
doing everything as string objects. However, I learned quickly on how to use these 
text files. It was pretty straightforward and I used the hasNext() and nextLine() 
methods successfully.
      
<-s>: At the end of my while loop, I forgot to close the file which caused by 
computer to hang and start glitching. I didn't until after I was done writing 
the entire program. But I quickly realized and fixed it. In the beginning, I 
changed the file that was supposed to be txt to a java file which also caused 
some complications but that got resolved failty quickly as well.

In the future: Making sure I understood the concept well had really helped in this 
project. In the future, I will make sure to continue this. Also, running a full scan 
helped since I added thinsg that I missed. I will also continue doing that as well.
