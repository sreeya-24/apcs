<+s>: This assessment wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I wrote my psuedocode on 
paper which helped a lot and everything from there ran smoothly. I used nested loops and 
also menu selections and although I forgot a bit on how to do the menu selections I wrote 
little by little from I remember and it all came back to me. The menu options that I put 
are a little bit different from the screenshot but they print they a password corresponding 
to that menu option..
      
<-s>: As I was trying to add a if statement for the fifth option which was quit, I ran into 
some trouble. After putting the if loop, the program did ask for the menu selection and it 
did print out the correct statements but it also continued asking for the number of 
characters. I didn't know how to quit it so I searched on the API on how to quit a 
program and it was very useful. After that I didn't run into anymore complications.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: Writing psuedocode really helped through the past assessments and also 
looking on the API website for certain functions really helped. It saved a lot of time.
In the future, I would continue writing my thoughts on papoer and looking up anything that 
I didn't know on the API website.
