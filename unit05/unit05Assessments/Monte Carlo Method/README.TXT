AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Compile and run the java file.

<+s>: This project was more on the difficult side as I didn't really understand the 
Monte Carlo Method. I was very confused on what I was supposed to do but after writing 
the psuedocode for this assessment it got more clear and I just made a few modifications 
to the code. However, I am still unclear on what the Monte Carlo Method actually is so I
will need to come back and visit this.
      
<-s>: I also forgot to close the file a couple times causing my computer to enter an 
infinite loop. When I was trying to get the sum of the bottle caps, I put the wrong 
function to add the tokens together so the sum and average were not accurate. I 
decided to write the whole thing out and it went smoothly after that.
           
***************************************************************************************
In the future: Writing a psuedocode on paper really helped me understand how to write 
the code. In the future, I will continue doing the same thing as it helped a lot through 
this.
