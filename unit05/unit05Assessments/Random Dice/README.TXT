**************************** P M R **********************************************************

<+s>: I was very confused on this project and didn't know where to start. I actually did 
not understand the project and what I was supposed to do for sometime. I was really stuck 
and confused. I actually didn't know how to start at all but after writing my thoughts on 
paper and preparing a psuedocode I was able to write my code and make modificatiosn to it.
      
<-s>: After getting down my loops and print statements, I started having trouble with my average. 
I did the correct calculation  but my casting was off. Everytime I ran the program, my 
average/probability was 0.0. So, i started to troubleshoot it by printing everything out and 
doing my casting from there. Finally, my casting was correct and my program started to run
smoothly.
           
*********************************************************************************************
In the future: I wrote my code as a psuedocode on a piece of paper. I also wrote down my 
thoughts which I think really helped me through this project. In the future as well, I will 
write my thoughts down and my code as a psuedocode to make the assessments easier.
