VERSION or DATE: 12/28/2021
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Compile and run
AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Compile and follow user input instructions

**************************** P M R ***************************************************
 
<+s>: It was actually a bit difficult to start this program because I didn't know how 
to use the for loop in this program and I also didn't know to generate a random number 
that produced three digits. But, I planned on a piece of papaer and also went through 
the process step by step.
      
<-s>: To generate random numbers with three digits, it took sometime but using my math 
skills I decided that the random number times 10 to the power of i would give us 
three digits. I put them all in a sum variable and I got a number. After that everything 
else went smooth.
           
***************************************************************************************
In the future: Planning on a piece of paper and going through the process step by step 
really helped me in wrting this code and doing this project. In the future, I would continue 
doing the same thing.
