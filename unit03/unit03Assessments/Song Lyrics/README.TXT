<+s>: I really liked this assessment because it was really fun choosing a song
and printing out the lyrics. It was really easy and I understood the concept 
really well. I thought that it was way more cleaner to just assign strings.
It was a breeze for me.
      
<-s>: I don't think there was any problems for other than the fact that my 
song was a bit on the longer side. I had to make a lot of strings and it was 
a lot of typing but overall I had fun.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: Understanding the concept was extremly helpful which is why 
this project was so easy. In the future, I would definitely make sure I 
understood that way the projects are not confusing.
