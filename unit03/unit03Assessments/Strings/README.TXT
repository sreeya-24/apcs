<+s>: This assessment was a bit challenging but after I got the hang of it I was
able to print my orginal message and my new modified message. I was a bit confused 
on the replaceAll function and how to use but after using my previous project that 
was all cleared up.
      
<-s>: After the confusion with the replaceAll function was cleared up, I was 
confused one more time because when I used that function to print all my 
abbreviations they wouldn't print all in one string. It took some time for me 
to figure out that I had to make new variables for each one and print the very 
final one.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I do not think I understood the concept very well in the beginning. 
In the future, I should understand it and make sure to practice some problems to 
really make sure I got a grasp on it.
