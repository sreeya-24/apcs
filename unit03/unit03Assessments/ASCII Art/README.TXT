**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: I had a fun time completing this project. I was a bit confused on how to 
print wihtout using println but the "\n" made it easy and it was quite surprising. 
It did take a lot of thought but after making my design, coding it was pretty fun.
      
<-s>: It was definitely time-consuming and I actually didn't know how to do my design 
without using println. I was also confused whether \n had a normal slash or a backslash 
so that caused some compiler errors.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: With this project, I definitely planned it out more than previous 
projects which made coding very easy. In the future I would plan it out more 
carefully.
