<+s>: The assessment was slightly confusing. I got stuck at one point and could not 
figure out what was error because the output was not running as expected. It took a 
while for me find out what was wrong and it turns out that you cannot put in.next 
for each string name that is going to be used in one print line. So, instead, I 
used in.nextLine for every string I used.
      
<-s>: I was also a bit stuck on printing out the messages below. To print them 
out you had to take certain parts from other strings and concatenate them. That 
took some time because it was a lot taking substrings of different strings. Overall, 
I felt a little frustrated when I was able to get out of the pithole. But in the end, 
I got it and it made snese.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future:  When I was frustrated, I sat at my tabke for every long time 
trying to figure out the problem and looking back at previous lessons. This 
made me feel more frustrated. So instead of just sitting there, I would 
take a break for a couple minutes then come back and review my notes and 
also take a look at the API to see if there is anything I could use.
