<+s>: The assessment was pretty self-explanatory and it was pretty easy for me 
to code it. I undertsood the scanner classes and functions and the lecture notes 
helped me a lot to grasp it.
      
<-s>: I did forget to include the import java.util at the top so that caused some 
errors and confusion but I soon got the hang of it. Overall, I enjoyed this project 
and was fairly easy.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: In the future, I would continue to read lecture notes and make 
sure I understood the concept and practice assessments before doing the actual 
one.
