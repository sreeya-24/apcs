<+s>: This project was more on the difficult side there was a lot of confusion, frustration, and relief 
moments. However, the end product was really nice and it really was a game of tictactoe. The instructions 
helped as I went through the project and when I look back at my code, it's a lot and I am wondering how 
I did that! There were a lot of problems I encountered doing this project and I became really frustrated 
so I had to step aside for a bit.

<-s>: Some of the problems were just small mistakes. However, there were some time-consuming errors. 
For example, one of them was that the grid didn't show up on the screen. On top of that it said that the 
computer was playing but it asked the user to enter a mark which weird. Even after entering the mark it 
didn't do anything and was in a loop of asking the user. After sometime I got the grid to show up but the 
computer wasn't really playing and none of the marks the user entered were showing up. I was really 
irritated at this point and stepped aside for the sake of my computer. After fixing that part, another 
issue sprung up. The computer and player were playing fine but when the player won the game, it didn't 
say that the player won and it didn't ask if the player wanted to continue. This problem was the one that 
took the longest to fix and there were a lot of things I had to fix. 
*******************************************************************************************************
In the future: I do need to practice on my trouble shooting because I took a pretty long time to figure 
out what were the errors and how to fix it.
