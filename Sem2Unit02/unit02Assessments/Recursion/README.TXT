PROJECT TITLE: There and Back Again
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This function calculates three different piecewise calculations using the 
recursive method.
VERSION or DATE: 2/13/2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Compile and run
AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Compile and run the main java file

<+s>: I understood the concept about recursion well. I thnk the piecewise calculations helped me 
a lot in understanding. I didn't have very much trouble while writing my code. The only trouble I 
had was when I was priting it. The last calculation gave the wrong answer and I realized that I 
forgot to change the inequalities and the return statements for them. After that I didn't have any 
other complications.I enjoyed doing this project.

<-s>: Once again, I didn't have much trouble with my code. I only had a bit of a problem on my 
last calculation but that was quickly resolved. I worked out my calculations beforehand so it 
helped when I printed it at the end. I think I understood this concept very well.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: Writing and planning beforehand on paper really helped me in this assessment. I 
will continue doing that to make sure I am not wasting any time thinking about it last minute.
