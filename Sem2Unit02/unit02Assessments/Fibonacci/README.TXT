PROJECT TITLE: Are We There Yet
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program prompts the user to enter a positive integer value and calculates the fibonacci value.
VERSION or DATE: 2/19/2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Compile and run
AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Compile and run the main java file

<+s>: Recursion with fibonacci number was pretty surprising. I understood the concept of 
recursion very well and I think piecewise functions, counting digits, and fibonacci numbers 
really contributed  to my understanding. I didn't run into too many complications however there 
some places where I was stuck.

<-s>: Writing the code just for one user input was no trouble. However, when I was trying to ask 
for the user input multiple times, I was a bit stuck. It took sometime before I realized that I 
could write a while loop to ask the user multiple times until they quit. After this was resolved, 
my program ran smoothly. In fact, I used the program to figure out how many cows Luke Edlebluth's 
brother had to wash. It was 13 cows!
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: To understand the function to calculate fibonacci numbers, I wrote all my 
calculations and thoughst on paper. This really helped me understand the project more. In the 
future I will continue writing my code down on paper for better understanding.
