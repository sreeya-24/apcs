**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: I never knew that palindromes were an example of recursions. It was quite surprising to 
know that recursive methods can be used to determine whether a word or phrase was a palindrome. 
I didn't run into many complications becaseu I took my code step by step. I didn't run into any 
syntax or runtime errors and my program ran smoothly.

<-s>: Although I didn't run into any errors, I did spend some time trying to figure out how I 
should invoke the helper method. For a couple minutes I didn't know what it was asking me to do 
but after some further analysis, I figured it out after trying certain words into my program. 
After that was resolved my program didn't run into anymore pitstops.

In the future: Taking the project step by step and breaking it up into smaller steps made it very 
easy and surprisingly less time consuming. In the future I will continue doing the same thing to save 
time and to tackle more complicated problems.
