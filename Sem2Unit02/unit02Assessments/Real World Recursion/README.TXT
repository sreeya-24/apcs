PROJECT TITLE: Real World Recursion
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This project introduces the concept of recursions and how they connect to real life situations.
VERSION or DATE:02/05/2022

AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Open the image file and the doc pdf(no java file)

**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: I was actually a bit confused on how to create my art without knowing how to code for 
recursions. It turns out that I wasn't coding anything and I was just creating a image. Becuase 
it was straight lines and reactangles, it was easier. But, I bet that if it was circles or any 
other curved shape, it would have been a bit harder. This assessment overall wasn't hard and I 
actually liked the questions that I answered to.

<-s>: Once again, there was nothing really hard in this program and by using real life situations 
like art, I think my understanding of recursions grew. This gave me a clear "analogy" of what 
recursions are.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I think connecting these computer science programs to real-life situations really 
helped me understand. In the future, I would take some time to connect the assessment to any day 
to day activity.
