<+s>: This assessment was definitely time-consuming, however, it was pretty straightforward. 
I didn't have any problem with converting Fahrenheit to celsius and inches to centimeters. 
But when it came to formatting it, I wasn't confused but I did forget sometimes to put the 
percent sign and it took sometime until I got the hang of it.
      
<-s>: Once again, I got stuck when I was using the formula to convert Fahrenheit to celsius. 
It kept on printing 0.0 for the temperature so I tried to cast it. But even then, it 
continued to show the same thing. After some time, I found out that I was supposed to cast 
one of the numbers in 5/9 instead of casting the entire expression.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I think going back to my casting notes helped me because that was where I spent 
the most time. In the future, I will review my notes and past lessons just to remember them.
