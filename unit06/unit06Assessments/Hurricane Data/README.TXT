<+s>: This project was really time consuming but it wasn't that hard. I did get stuck on a 
couple places and I got confused when writing certain loops. I also got confused on where to 
declare a variable(inside a loop or outside). The formatting, however, took the most time since 
it was kind of like trial and error for me. After that, my program ran smoothly and I didn't run 
into any other complications.
      
<-s>: Like I said, I spent the most time trying to format everything and make it look nice. 
I am still a little unsure on formatting and sometimes I forget about certaint hings. But, 
with practice, I think I will be able to get it.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I wrote my code on paper which was helpful as always but I also looked back on 
my notes on formatting since I was a little confused on that concept. By doing that, I didn't 
waste too much time by guess and checking. In the future, I will look back on my notes to help
me move forward.
