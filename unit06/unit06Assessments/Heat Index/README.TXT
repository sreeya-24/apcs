<+s>: This project was on the easy side. I didn't really run inot any complications othe than 
formatting. My code was runniong smoothly and displayed the content but I had to format it to make
 sure it was alligned. Also, the formula was really long which took sometime but because I put 
 everything into one variable it was easy afterwards.
      
<-s>: Formatting took some time. I had to format the values and also the heading. I also had to 
format the months which tooks sometime because if the months were not alligned than the values 
were not alligned. But after formatting everything went smoothly.

In the future: Writing my code on paper helped many times in the past and it helped me once again 
this time as well. I will continue writing my plans on paper before actually coding.
