<+s>: This assessment wasn't that hard. I understood the concept well and it didn't take me 
that long. I modified a couple of names and added a couple more methods to get and return certain 
things. At the end all I had to do was format it the additional columns. Declaring instance variables 
was fairly easy and straightforward. But there were couple extra steps to access them.
      
<-s>: At one point, my distance and the GPM were not printly properly. They kept showing 0 which 
was odd because the distance was supposed to be 200. I had to troubleshoot it to see what was 
actually happening and it turns out that I couldn't have the same variable names in the 
constructors as the instance variables. The distance printed out propery but the GPM still 
showed 0.0. It turns out that my formatting was off by a couple decimal points and theyw ere not 
showing. After changing that, my program ran smoothly.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I think I still need practice on formatting and also how to format decimal numbers. 
In the future, I will be very careful with my formatting and also practice somemore.
