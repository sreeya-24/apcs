<+s>: This assessment was fairly easy and I think I understood the concept of default 
constructors. The only tough part was filling out the gas mileage worksheet of my car since 
my parent and I didn't remember anything. However, we used estimated numbers and that problem 
was quickly solved. I had no trouble writing the methods and calling them in the main. Everything 
went smoothly and i am really grateful for the practoce before this.
      
<-s>: I spent the most time formatting but it didn't take as long as it used to. With practice, 
I think this will become easy. Other than that I didn't run into anymore complications. I had 
fun doing this project because it's kind of based off of real-life experiences.

In the future: Practicing with all those lecture notes really helped me understand the concept 
and I didn't have any problems. In the future, I will continue to practice with the lecture notes 
to make sure I understand.
