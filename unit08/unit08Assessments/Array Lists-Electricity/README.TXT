**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: This assessment wasn't as hard, infact I understood the concept well. Array lists are 
definitly way more efficient than arrays. I didn't run into any issues while writing my code and 
writing the methods wasn't that hard either. I actually got my program on the first time I wrote it 
which usually doesn't happen.
      
<-s>: Again, there were no issues and surprisingly, this time it didn't take that long to format it 
too. Usually formatting took the longest time in my previous projects. Infact, the add method was 
pretty easy to use and understand.

In the future: Writing my code on paper and planning really helped me. In the future I will 
continue planning my code on papaer before actually coding.
