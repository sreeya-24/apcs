<+s>: This assessment was time consuming and I spent a lot of planning. But, that planning 
helped when I was programing. I didn't run into any compilcations but it was very time consuming. 
I didn't know what annual projection was so it took me some time to figure out how it was calculated. 
After that, formatting was the only thing that took the most time and my program ran smoothly.
     
<-s>: Again, I didn't know what annual projection was but using my resources and context clues I 
confirmed how to calculate annual projection. I think I need more practice with formatting, e
specially formatting big and a lot of objects.

In the future: Planning on a piece of paper really helped me "zoom" through this program. In 
the future, I will continue to write on a piece of paper and plan my code before starting.
