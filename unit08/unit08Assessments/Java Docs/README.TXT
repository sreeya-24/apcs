**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: This assessment was on the easier side and I didn't get any problems while writing my code. 
I think I understood the concept pretty well and I used the class diagram and my own planning. It 
didn't take that long although I was kind of surpirsed to see how much CO2 we are emitting for 
one year. I think I also understood how to write javadoc comments. I used the template and the 
lesson source code.
      
<-s>: Again, there were not any complications or anything that stopped me from coding or confused 
me. I did have fun writing the code I also got to learn a lot about my car and how much CO2 it's 
releasing. 
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: Using the class diagram really helped me through writing this code and helped 
avoid confusion. In the future I will continue using the class diagram and planning out my strategy.
