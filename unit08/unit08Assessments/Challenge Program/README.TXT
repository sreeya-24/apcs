**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: I was a bit confused with this assessment because I wasn't really sure how to put the code 
from the other projects into this one. But, I decided to put all the instance variables from all 
projects into this one. Then go and make methods from their using the assessment instructions and 
the expected output. I didn't run into any issues other than when I was formatting.
      
<-s>: Formatting took the longest time and once again, it was bunch of trial and error. I 
defintly need more practice on formatting. It became a little frustrating so I had to take a 
break from it but I came back and finished it all.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: In the future, I need to practice more of formatting and also, when I feel stuck 
or frustrated, it's helpful to take a break and come back to it.
