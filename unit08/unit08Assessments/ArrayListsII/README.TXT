<+s>: This project was not that hard however it took some time to format it and complete it. I 
didn't really run into issues other than when I was formatting the output but there were no runtime 
or syntax errors in my code. The output at first glance looked very complicated and I thought that 
this was going to be a hard project, but the coding part was easy. It was only formatting that was 
really frustrating for me.
      
<-s>: I think I need more practice on formatting because it took a very long time to get all the 
lines and everything alligned. It was all trial and error which was a pain. But other than that, 
I didn't really have any other issues.

In the future: In the future, planning would be must because it helped me a lot during this project. 
The class diagram was also very helpful.
