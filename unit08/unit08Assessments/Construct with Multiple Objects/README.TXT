<+s>: TI was a bit a confused at the beginning and I didn't really understand the project. I 
went back to read the notes and review the lecture notes and it helped a lot. After that, it was 
all easy. But other that, it went pretty smoothly. I just had difficulty finding different cars 
and their fuel efficency. However, I did use my resources and got the information. After that my 
program ran smoothly.
      
<-s>: Again formatting took sometime but I didn't really run into any pitstops. It was a little 
consuming but I actually enjoyed making the methods and the different classes. I finished faster 
than before.

In the future: Understanding the lecture notes really helped me through this program. In the future, 
I will continue to make sure I understand what is happening and what the concept is.
