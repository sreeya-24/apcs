<+s>: I think this project was faily easy except this type of search is a little bit more 
complicated and it was a lot more steps. However, I think this project wasn't that hard 
especially because I wrote down my code and try to think of the logic and algorithm. I also 
explained it to myself and viewed the lecture notes whihc helped a lot. I didn't really get 
stuck anywhere after I ran the program, the output was correct.

<-s>: I didn't run into any errors while writing my code and there weren't any runtime errors 
either. I didn't have a problem and I think I fully understood the concept however I feel a need 
to go back and review because this topic is a bit complicated.

In the future: Again, writing stuff on paper really helps and I will continue to do that.
