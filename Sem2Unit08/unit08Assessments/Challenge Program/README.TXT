**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: This project wasn't too hard. I didn't really have much trouble with it because I feel 
like I understood the concepts. I had no trouble finishing this project. In fact I didn't get 
any errors in the process and I felt really good after finishing it.

<-s>: Again, I had no errors or problems doing it. I didn't run into any problems and was actually quote surprised at myself because I thought that this unit was hard.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I don't have anything in particular for this project, but the AP exam is coming 
up and I think I will studying for that.
