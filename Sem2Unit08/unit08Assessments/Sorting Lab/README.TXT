<+s>: This project was pretty big but not that hard because I feel like I understood most of the 
concepts. I didn't run inot any trouble or problems and I think it went pretty smoothly. This is 
basically the last coding project for this course so it was like a big deal.

<-s>: Again, I didn't run into any problems so everything was smooth and it felt really weird 
because it's my last project.

In the future: Continue to practice my skills.
