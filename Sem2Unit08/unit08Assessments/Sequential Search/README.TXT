**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: This project was pretty easy. I think I understood the concept of sequential searching 
well. I didn't really have any problems because the virtual lecture notes helped me a lot. 
There were no syntax or runtime errors which is great. I did have some trouble when I was 
writing the main function but I fixed that in no time.

<-s>: In the main function, after I called the methods, I kept getting errors and it kept saying 
the get method was static and cannot call on a non-static method. But, I realized that I forgot 
to put static in the search methods. After that my program ran smoothly. 
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I think making sure I thoroughly understand the lecture notes is important and I
will continue to do that.
