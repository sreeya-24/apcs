<+s>: The assessment was fairly straightforward and I didn't have to many 
complications while writing the code. I think I understood the concept well 
and it went by pretty smoothly. I took sometime of this project so when I came 
back, I forgot some concepts but after reading the lecture notes I remembered quickly.
      
<-s>: I did have some difficulty with the if sentences because I didn't if i could 
put if else and then else if again so I put all of them separately in the beginning.
But, I tried and it worked so that complication was resolved quickly. Other than 
that I didn't have any complications.
           
********************************************************************************
In the future: I found out that instead of just sitting there and wondering if 
something will work, trying to see if it actually works can actually save a lot 
of time. So in the future, instead of wondering whether something will, 
I would just try it because it could end up working.
