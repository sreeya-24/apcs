PROJECT TITLE: Heart Rate Target Zone
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program takes user inout of age, resting heart rate, 
and heart rate after exercise to calculate the target zone for that person 
and checks whether their heart rate after exercise is within that target zone.
VERSION or DATE: 11/25/2021
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Compile and run
AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Compile and run the java file and enter input as per instructions

<+s>: This assessment was pretty easy because I understood the concepyt of if-conditions 
and I already had previous knowledge of them before. It was easy to write the code because 
I already planned it out beforehand. It was pretty fun I think this is a very useful tool.
      
<-s>: Everything was easy and self-explanatory until it came to the if-statments. I put two 
if statements. One to print out a message if the heart was within the target zone and one to 
print a message if it was outside of the target zone. The one within the target zone came out 
pretty well when the heart rate was within the target zone. However, when the heart rate was 
outside of target zone it didn't print out anything and I was stuck their for sometime. It 
turns out that instead of putting "and" between two statements I had to put "or." Once that 
was fixed, It came out perfectly.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: Because I had a plan before writing out my code, I was able to 
easily get this done without many pitstops. In the future, I would continue to 
plan it out beforehand and make sure to avoid silly mistakes.
