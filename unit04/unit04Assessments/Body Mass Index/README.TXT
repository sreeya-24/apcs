**************************** P M R *********************************************

<+s>: I learned about Body Mass Index after this assesment. I was little stucked 
up when checking if condition with double having lot of  values after decimal point.
      
<-s>: I learned a way of converting a double ot string and then using substring 
to get the BMI to the required decimal point.
           
********************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to explore more possibilites of converting from one 
data type or other and vice-versa and also I would like to learn how to stop a double 
after one decimal point.
