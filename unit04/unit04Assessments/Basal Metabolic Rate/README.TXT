**************************** P M R ************************************************
 
<+s>: The assessment was pretty easy and I had a fun time learning about the 
Basal Metabolic Rate. I was confused at first about how I was going to use the 
if-else function but I soon found out that it was different for male and females. 
I didn't have that much difficulty doing this project.
      
<-s>: There was one point where my one of my if conditions wasn't working and I 
had no idea why. I was stuck there for a little bit because I forgot how to put
 a character into a if-else statment. But, I remember and everything else was 
 breeze after that. It was not too dificult.
           
***********************************************************************************
In the future: Because I forgot how to inout certain things into the if-else 
condition, I think next time I should review my notes before doing the project.
That way, I am not wasting time trying to remember.
