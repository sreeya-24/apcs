**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The assessment was easy and I understood the concept of conparing strings 
pretty well. I really didn't have any problem with anything and the entire 
assessment was a breeze.
      
<-s>: There were no errors in this assessment and everything ran smoothly. 
I made sure to check whether it would say the right statement if I entered a 
character that wasn't an option and it did. I tried all the menu options and 
everything went good.
           
********************************************************************************
In the future: Again, understanding the concept really helped and I didn't get 
any runtime or errors or syntax errors. I would be doing that in the future as 
well.
