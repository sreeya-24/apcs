<+s>: This assessment was really fun and was really easy to do understand. Because the 
daily value of each category was provided for us, all we had to do write our boolean 
functions and print functions. It was self-explanatory and it was pretty easy to write the code.
      
<-s>: As I said before, this assessment was pretty easy and I had no problems writing the code. 
The formatting however for the output of the very last part wasn't completely alligned because 
each number takes a certain space which messes up the allignment of the other categories.
***********************************************************************************************************
In the future: I would make sure I practiced the problems and really understood the 
concept because doing that was helpful this assessment.
