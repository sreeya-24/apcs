**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: This project was like a big review for me because it's been some time since I came across 
interations and recursions. But, I think with some review and some of the virtual lecture notes, 
I think I got it. There were some methods that were confusing for me and I skipped them and came 
back to them later. But after looking at notes and read the lectures, I think I got it. Other than 
that, I think it was fairly easy.

<-s>: The StringGen method was a bit confusing because I didn't know how I would make a string print 
multiple times. But, that probelem was solved because I did some review and read some notes. I wrote 
it down after and that's when I got the logic.I didn't really have any problems after that.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I think I should review iteratiosn and recursions and maybe all of lessons so I 
am not forgetting anything. I will also write my code on paper before writing it on BlueJ.
