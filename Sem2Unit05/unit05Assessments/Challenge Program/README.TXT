**************************** P M R********************************************************************
 
<+s>: This project was a bit confusing at the beginning. I didn't really know how to begin this project 
because I had no idea. I started to plan out the project and break it down. Then, I started to work the 
logic out on paper. I tried find ways on how I could each little step. After figuring out a pseudocode, 
I started to write my code. When I ran it, it SEEMED to run fine but when I started to decode the secret 
message, that's when all the trouble and frustration started.

<-s>: While I was decoding the message, none of the letters matched up and the words didn't make any 
sense. They just looked like a bunch of letters out together. I tried a couple of times with different 
word combinations and I was really confused. I decided to turn all of the letters to uppercase so that 
it wouldn't cause any confusion and inaccuracy. even after doing thta, many of the letters didn't match 
up and weird words started forming instead of sensful words. I was really confused and I was starting to 
get agitated at this point. After some contemplating, it turns out that I had to take the average of all 
of the letters. After doing this, the letters were much more accurate. There were some similarites but 
it was easy to figure the words.
*******************************************************************************************************
In the future: Breaking down the project into smaller steps and writing a pseudocode was pretty helpful 
in this project. In the future I would continue to do the same thing.
