**************************** P M R********************************************************************
 
<+s>: I had no trouble finishing this project. In fact I didn't get any errors in the process and I felt 
really good after finishing it. I think I understood the concept of abstraction and implementation pretty 
well and I have my own personal definitions of them for me to understand. The assessment instructions took 
me step by step throughout the process and it was really helpful.

<-s>: Again, I had no errors or problems doing it. I was just confused on the toString part because I 
didn't know if I was doing it right. But after running the program it turned out that it was right. But 
other than that, I didn't run into any problems or pitstops.
*******************************************************************************************************
In the future: Breaking down the project into smaller steps and writing a pseudocode was pretty helpful 
in this project. In the future I would continue to do the same thing.
