**************************** P M R********************************************************************
 
<+s>: I didn't really have trouble finishing this project. Because I understood the previous assignment 
which was somewhat similar to this, I think it was much easier to grasp this concept as well. There were 
a lot of classes involved but much of it was similar code with just few changes here and there.

<-s>: Again, I had no trouble with this project. The only thing was that when I ran it the first time, 
the math part came something different. It didn't take that long to fix it. I forgot to add the toString 
method in it.
*******************************************************************************************************
In the future: Understanding previous lectures and projects helped a lot in this project. I would continue 
to do the same thing in the future.
