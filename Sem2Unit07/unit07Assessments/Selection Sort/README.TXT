<+s>: I think out of all the types of sorts, this sort was the most easiest to understand and 
do. The bubble sort and insertion sort seemed more complicated than this one. There were more 
steps involved and personally it was harder to understand them. The selection sort was pretty 
easy for me and writing the code wasn't that hard. I was confused for a little bit at one part 
but other than that, I think my code ran successfully.

<-s>: For the previous project and this project, i was ocnfused about having a parameter that 
if it's a one, it's ascending and if it's a two, it's descending. I didn't know what it meant 
but I just added a an if loop for both of them. But, I understood what that was for. It was the 
sortion of the array in either ascending or descending order. After that, I didn't really have 
any other problems and wrote my code successfully.

In the future: Writing and planning beforehand on paper really helped me in this assessment. I 
will continue doing that to make sure I am not wasting any time thinking about it last minute.
