<+s>: This project was time-consuming and I spent a couple hours on it. But ut wasn't too hard. 
I did had to look back at my notes but it wasn't too hard. The sorting part took the most time 
because there was a lot of code involved and it was just a lot of for and if loops. But, I didn't 
have any trouble writing the code and I think it was pretty successful.

<-s>: I didn't really have any trouble writing the code but I did have to look back on previous 
projects and notes to make sure I am doing it right. Other than that, I didn't have much trouble 
with my code. I also wrote it down on paper a little bit before writing it and I think that's what 
helped me a lot.

***********************************************************************************************
In the future: Writing and planning beforehand on paper really helped me in this assessment. I 
will continue doing that to make sure I am not wasting any time thinking about it last minute.
