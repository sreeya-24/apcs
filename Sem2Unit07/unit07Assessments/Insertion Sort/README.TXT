**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: I understood the concept about insertion sort well. I actually didn't have any problems 
with my code. However, the code in the TestMovie2 was really lengthy so that took a lot of time 
to write it. But the output was correct and it was nice to work with some of my child hood movies. 
I just modified my output a little bit so it looks less jumbled and confusing. I decided to use arrays 
instead of array lists just because the array[i] is better than writing get[i]. But I didn't have any 
runtime or syntax errors. I didn't get stuck anywhere too.

<-s>: Once again, I didn't have much trouble with my code. I didn't have problems and my program 
ran fine and the output looks organized.

In the future: Writing and planning beforehand on paper really helped me in this assessment. I 
will continue doing that to make sure I am not wasting any time thinking about it last minute.
