**************************** P M R************************************************************
 
<+s>: This lessons was somewhat confusing because instead of having one method that sorts, you 
have two which sorts but also calls another merge function. It took me a while to understand why 
but I slowly started to get it. However I think I need go back a review it again because I am 
not fully sure about this lesson. But with some help of the lecture notes and the eIMACS I was 
able to write my code without any runtime or syntax errors. 

<-s>: Once again, I need to go back to this lesson and make sure I get it fully before my AP test. 
I didn't have any syntax errors and I didn't get stuck anywhere thanks to the lecture notes and 
the examples. I still am a bit confused about it but I think with so more practice I can understand 
it and master it.
           
***********************************************************************************************
In the future: I will go back to this lesson and other lessons I need help on to make sure I 
understand it fully.
