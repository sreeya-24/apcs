PROJECT TITLE: Prime Numbers
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program asks the user to enter a number and calculates the prime numbers from 1 to that number.
VERSION or DATE: 04/16/2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Compile and run
AUTHORS: Sreeya Gambhirrao
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Compile and run and enter input as per instructions

**************************** P M R********************************************************************
 
<+s>: This assessment wasn't too hard. I didn't really have any difficulty with the logic and code. I 
first try to figure out how to find prime numbers on a mthematical basis before trying to figure out the 
code. It made writing the code way easier because I knew the logic. I didn't run into any compile or 
runtime errors and my program ran smoothly.

<-s>: I didn't have any errors or problems while or after writing my code. It ran pretty smoothly and 
it works fine.
*******************************************************************************************************
In the future: Planning out the logic especially if the program involves math really helped in this 
project. I will continue doing the same thing throughout all my projects.
