<+s>: This project was really interesting and when it ran without any errors, it was really fun to play 
around with. I didn't really run into any problems except when I was trying to decrypt the message. I 
figured it out eventually so it wasn't a huge problem. But other than that, there weren't any major mind 
boggling probelms. At the end, I had my family members test it out and they found extremely interesting.

<-s>:I did have trouble in the decryption part. When I tried to decrypt, sometimes the output would be 
completely different or it would add and encrypt rather than decrypt. I had to look at the formula and 
make sure everything was in the right place. Parentheses became a huge factor and I had to make sure I 
had all of the parentheses in the right place. But after some fixing here and there, it finally worked 
and my program was up and running.

In the future: Breaking the assessment into steps is really helpful and it helped a lot in this program 
as well. In the fture, I would continue to break my assessment into smaller steps and parts to easily 
accomplish the project.
