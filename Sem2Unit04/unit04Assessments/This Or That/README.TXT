<+s>: There wasn't much to do in the program but it showed the uses of the keyword "this." It was a 
simple project and I think I understood why we use the keyword this. I feel like this is somewhat 
convenient because when I declare private instance variables and intialize them in the constructor, 
I don't really know what to name the parameters of the constructors. So now I don't have to think much 
and whenever I have same names I can just use this.

<-s>: I didn't have any problems with writing my code. I knew that if the variable names were the same, 
I just had to add "this" and that would fix the problem. I think that the virtual notes helped a lot with 
understanding the concept.
*******************************************************************************************************
In the future: Virtual lecture notes help a lot and I think understanding those will help me in 
understanding the project. In the future I will continue to understand the lecture notes.
