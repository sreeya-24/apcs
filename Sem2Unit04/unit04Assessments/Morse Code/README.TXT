<+s>: I think this project went really smooth and it was great way for me to brush up on my 
previous skills and knowledge. I didn't run into any problems but it was a bit difficult to convert 
it into morse code. At the beginning I had no idea on how I would it. But, I did soon figure out that 
after reading the file, I have to put it into an array. And, I just went from there.

<-s>:Again, I didn't run into any complications. When I ran the program, it came up as index out of 
bounds but that didn't take very long to fix. I just had to modify a couple things and done! After 
that, my program ran very smoothly. I think it was pretty interesting to see morse code especially
because I have never used it or even tried it out. I didn't really know how morse code worked but this 
program pushed me into researching more.

In the future: Reviewing on previous skills is very helpful. This project made me realize that I should 
look through my past lessons so I do not forget them. In future, I would continue to review and brush up
on the lessons.
